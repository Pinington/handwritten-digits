# Hand Written Digit Recognition
This project uses convolutional neural networks to predict a handwritten digit's value. The goal is to create website where hand written digits are recognized, and potentially a way to implement full hand written equations to be solved.

# Usage
After running train.py, a mnist_cnn.pth file is created with the model's parameters, as well as the training data if not already installed. Use main.py to try it out on a specific image
